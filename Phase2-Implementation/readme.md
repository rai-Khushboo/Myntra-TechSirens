## Myntra Designer Collaboration Platform 🌍🤝👗

## Project Description
🌟 Step 1: Designers will register with authentication.

🔍 Step 2: Young brands must register with government verification. After registration, they can verify their brands and begin selling their designs online on Myntra.

🎉 Step 3: Approved brands will receive their own brand page where they can upload their designs. Myntra has the option to purchase these designs. Subsequently, Myntra will retail these new designer outfits to the Gen-Z audience.

This platform empowers emerging designers and brands to showcase and sell their creations efficiently, ensuring authenticity and accessibility for both sellers and buyers.
